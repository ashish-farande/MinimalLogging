# MinimalLogging

This is a hobby Project based on the "Minimal Structured Logging for Autonomous Vehicles" presentation given by Robert Keelan during CppCon 2019.

I am open to any suggestions to improve this code.

TODO:
1. Required: Update GetTypeDescriptor for all datatypes from types.h -> needs update to visitors in io_handler
2. Optional: See if we can provide some support for custom data types
