# MinimalLogging

This is a hobby Project based on the "Minimal Structured Logging for Autonomous Vehicles" presentation given by Robert Keelan during CppCon 2019.

I am open to any suggestions to improve this code.

TODO:
1. Make the SW more robust to reading and writing data to the file
2. Provide support to all the primitive datatypes
2. See if we can provide some support for custom data types
